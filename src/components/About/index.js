                <p> I am a burgeoning frontend web developer with a background in creative writing. Recently obtained a certificate in full stack development from Butler University Executive Education Bootcamp. I am deeply proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript and various frameworks that contribute to an optimized user experience. Iâ€™ve had hands-on experience building various applications including a MERN stack SPA and a full stack roleplaying game utilizing the MVC structure. I enjoy working in teams as well as being self-sufficient in solo projects and tasks. Always looking to build on my knowledge and stay current with the latest techniques. I am looking forward to new opportunities that offer exciting challenges. Thank you for your consideration.
